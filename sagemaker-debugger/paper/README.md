The notebook [Case-Study.ipynb](Case-Study.ipynb) contains all details on how to run SageMaker training jobs with profiling enabled. It showcases different training configurations such:
- single GPU training
- mulit GPU training using PyTorch DataParallel
- multi GPU training using PyTorch DsitributedDataParallel

The notebook also shows how to create the visualizations of profiling data while the traianing is in progress. You can find an executed version of the notebook in [Case-Study.html](Case-Study.html) 
that includes all interactive visualizations and graphs.
